## Introduction
American Tire Distributors (ATD) is one of the largest independent suppliers of tires to the replacement tire market. They operate more than 140 distribution centers, including 25 distribution centers in Canada, serving approximately 80,000 customers across the U.S. and Canada. Despite ATD being a leader in the industry, delivering over 44MM tires annually, ATD faces challenges how many scrap tires will be collected by a given Distribution Center every day. Answering this question can help them refine their  downstream logsitics of scrap tire recycling and reduce cost.

Under their sponsorhsip a hackathon was organized where a challenge was given to forecast the number of scrap tires that a ATD distribution center will receive a week ahead from a day.

## About Dataset
The dataset comprised of columns such as date, number of tires recieved, location of a ATD distrbution center, its zip code, size code of a tire and retail price of a scrap tire. Historical data from September 20, 2020, to September 19, 2022 was available for analysis. The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/skswar/Forecasting_ScrapTire_Receipt_ATD/blob/main/dataset/ATD_train_data.csv).
